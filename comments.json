People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.\r  \n\r  \nWe have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems.

I will just choose the best that benefit is mean the most", "People are telling you to wait because they think the stock market is going to continue going down.  \"Buy Low, sell High.\"  The counter to that is people do a poor job deciding when a security is low or a security is high.\n\nA lot of people maintain that dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) is a good way to invest periodically.  Some people assert that since we can't know what's low or high, that statistically DCA provides superior results.\n\nPersonally, I find that I do better in the market if I have a rule / formula / algorithm behind the decision I make.  Having a rule takes the emotion out.\n\nThere are 4 basic places you can put money:\n\n* in a tax-advantaged investment account\n* in a taxable investment account\n* in a bank account\n* under your mattress.\n\nI think all 4 are important.  \n\nThe idea behind an emergency fund is to keep the money accessible and \"safe\" from investment losses.  That fund is there to cover unexpected expenses, so you don't want to sell some of your Apple stock at a loss to cover an unexpected expense.\n\nThe idea behind 401k and IRAs is to save money for retirement.  Those accounts are tax advantaged.  A 529 is also tax advantaged, but it's for educational expenses.\n\nA taxable investment account is someplace to put money that you might want to spend in the distant future, but before you're eligible for retirement.  Maybe a big vacation trip.  Or a new car.\n\nSo....  I think you're being lazy on saving for retirement, and you need to step up and put more in.  I'd go two-fold:\n\n1.  I'd max out how much wifey puts into her IRA every year.  The limit for 2022 is 6k, and you've got almost a month to put that 6k in for 2022.  The limit for 2023 is 6.5k.\n2. I'd contribute more to your 401k.\n3. In total, I'd target saving 10 - 15 percent of your combined income to your combined retirement accounts.\n\nLooking at investments daily or monthly is only going to convince you that investments are bad.  On average the stock market grows at 10% per year...but some years it drops 20%.  2022 was one of those years.  BUT...  if you compare the NAV of your 401k funds to what it was 5 years ago...  I bet it's up considerably...even with the drop last year.\n\nJust remember what you're doing when you buy a mutual fund...  you're buying ***shares*** of a mutual fund.  As the value of a share goes up, the value of your account goes up.  If you're investing $100 a month in the fund, when it's down you're buying more shares...your $100 goes a little further.", "Lol seriously.

First, remove any visible larvae or pupae by hand or with a tool and dispose of them in a sealed container. Then, turn the soil over in your raised beds to expose any hidden larvae. You can also use natural insecticides like neem oil or Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) and encourage natural predators like birds and beneficial insects to visit your garden. Additionally, practice good garden hygiene by removing dead plant material and consider using row covers or netting to protect your crops. By following these steps, you can help keep moth larvae under control and protect your garden from damage.
