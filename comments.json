People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.\r  \n\r  \nWe have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.\r  \n\r  \nA famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles.

Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nThis is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.\r  \n\r  \nYou don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise.
