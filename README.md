Project Summary:

Title: Subreddit Sentiment Tracker (MVP)

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a web application that tracks the sentiment of recent comments in a select group of popular subreddits, similar to a stock tracking app. The app will collect comments using the Reddit API, analyze their sentiment using TextBlob, calculate the average sentiment score for each subreddit, and display the scores in a simple table on a web interface. Users will be able to refresh the sentiment scores manually and sort subreddits based on their sentiment scores.

Context: This project is intended to validate the concept of tracking subreddit sentiment in real-time and determine if it is interesting and useful enough to warrant further development. The MVP will serve as a foundation for a more feature-rich application if the concept proves successful. The tasks provided are designed to be small, manageable steps to be completed by an AI+human collaboration team. The team should keep in mind that this is an MVP and focus on basic functionality and accuracy, with the potential for future expansion.

Files:

* `tasks.txt` - a list of tasks to implement this project.
* `requirements.txt` - pip installed packages for this venv
* `subreddits.txt` - 10 interesting subreddits for sentiment analysis tracking
* `collect_comments.py` - collects 10 comments form each subreddit and saves them in `comments.json`
* `comments.json` - generated by `collect_comments.py`, formatted as a JSON object with keys representing the subreddits and values representing the comments. Each subreddit key maps to a list of comments. The comments are represented as strings.

{
    "funny": [
        "This is hilarious!",
        "Thanks for sharing this!"
    ],
    "pics": [
        "Wow, that's an amazing photo!",
        "Thanks for sharing this!"
    ],
    "aww": [
        "That's so cute!",
        "Thanks for sharing this!"
    ]
}
```
* `sentiment_analysis.py` - reads comments from `comments.json` and generates a `sentiments.json` file, a JSON object with keys representing the subreddits and values representing the average sentiment score for each subreddit. The sentiment scores are represented as floating-point numbers:
```
{
        "funny": 0.5,
        "pics": 0.8,
        "aww": 0.9
}
```
* main.py: This file contains the Flask application setup and logic for displaying subreddit sentiment scores. It uses data from the `sentiments.json` file to render an HTML template (`index.html`) that displays the sentiment scores in a table.
* templates/index.html: This file contains the HTML and JavaScript code for displaying and sorting the subreddit sentiment scores. It includes a table that displays the subreddit names and their average sentiment scores, as well as basic CSS styles to make the table look nicer.
